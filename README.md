# Map_Project
Using real data in civ maps and mapscripts
Map class can be used to import data from nc files, create empty maps and sample them, plot maps and save data as .csv which can be pasted into civ maps.
There is a specific function for getting data from the .csv files from civ quickly and ploting them.
There is also an elevation function which calls Google Maps Platform to get elevation data at any point you want. You will need an API key from Google Cloud Platform and be aware that you only get 3,000 free calls a month. Each call can have 500 locations in it.
